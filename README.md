MayaTurretRoofCreator

When this is run inside the script editor in Maya, it creates a basic square-based tiled roof object. Editing the attributes section at the top of the code allows changing the dimensions of the roof and the number of rows of tiles.
I made this as part of one of my assignments for the CGI tools unit on my MSc course at Bournemouth university; the assignment was to create a ball bouncing round an impossible structure, and the roof was added as part of the decoration of the impossible structure.
